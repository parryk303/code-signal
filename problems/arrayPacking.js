/*
You are given an array of up to four non-negative integers, each less than 256.

Your task is to pack these integers into one number M in the following way:

The first element of the array occupies the first 8 bits of M;
The second element occupies next 8 bits, and so on.
Return the obtained integer M.

Note: the phrase "first bits of M" refers to the least significant bits of M - the right-most bits of an integer. For further clarification see the following example.

Example

For a = [24, 85, 0], the output should be
solution(a) = 21784.

An array [24, 85, 0] looks like [00011000, 01010101, 00000000] in binary.
After packing these into one number we get 00000000 01010101 00011000 (spaces are placed for convenience), which equals to 21784.
*/

function solution(a) {
    while (a.length < 4)
            a.push(0);
        return a[3] << 24 | a[2] << 16 | a[1] << 8 | a[0];
    }
